// this test case demonstrates the use of single primitive argument of type Number which returns a Number
// the threshold used here is 0.65
function fibonacci(n) {
	if (n == 0 || n == 1)
		return n;
	else
		return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);

}

fibonacci(1);
fibonacci(2);
fibonacci(3);
fibonacci(5);
fibonacci(5);

// this test case is similar to that in fibonacci.js except that in this, there is a minimal calls to the function with the same argument. The motivation here is to not make it a memoizable opportunity

/* below is the result obtained from running the instrumentation
